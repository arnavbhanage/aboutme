Arnav Bhanage | Professional Online Resume

This repository hosts my single-page online resume, designed for clarity, professionalism, and a modern aesthetic. It is built entirely using standard HTML5 and CSS3 to showcase core frontend and design skills.

‚ú® Key Features

Single-Screen Layout: Optimized using CSS Grid to display all key sections (Education, Skills, Experience, Projects) without vertical scrolling, providing an immediate overview of qualifications.

Professional Dark Theme: High-contrast design using a near-black background (#0d0d0d) and vibrant electric blue (#00bfff) accents, offering a polished yet contemporary look.

Structured Box Model: Precise use of padding, margin, and borders to create clear visual separation between content areas.

Responsive Base: Designed with fluid widths to adapt efficiently across devices (though optimized for desktop viewing).

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

HTML5: Semantic structure.

CSS3: Styling and advanced layout (:root variables, Flexbox, CSS Grid).

Fonts: Montserrat and Roboto for modern, highly readable typography.
